# KOLKATA_METRO_MAP_NAVIGATOR
Google map is an efficient application showing for the shortest path . Google maps application is built
using Dijkstra’s algorithm.we build the same application for the metro using Dijkstra’s algorithm. It is the efficient way to find the minimum distance between nodes using the edge values .we consider the stations as nodes and distance as edges. So we find the shortest time path.
